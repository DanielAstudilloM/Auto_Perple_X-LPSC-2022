# Auto_modelling

This library of python funtions can be used to use Perple_X modeller in a way to be automatized.

I do not own nor have modified any of the Perple_X files. For more information about this software go to https://www.perplex.ethz.ch/
Perple_x is a program created by James A. D Connolly. 

References:
Connolly (1990) - describes the calculation of mixed-variable diagrams and Schreinemakers projections. This reference also reviews phase diagram terminology (see also the appendix of Connolly & Petrini 2002) and explains the distinctions among thermodynamic, saturated phase, and saturated components. This reference is appropriate for calculations made with CONVEX.

Connolly (2005) - describes the gridded minimization strategy and the use of linear programming for optimization, which was introduced into the program in 2001. This reference is appropriate for calculations made in VERTEX.

Connolly (2009) - describes the adaptive optimization algorithm introduced in Perple_X 07 and currently used in Perple_X 6.6.6+. This reference is appropriate for calculations made in VERTEX and MEEMUM. This paper also has a better statement of the optimization problem than given in prior Perple_X papers.

Connolly & Galvez (2018) - describes the lagged speciation algorithm for electrolytic fluids.

Connolly & Kerrick (1987) - describes a strategy for defining the minimum free energy surface of a system as a function of its composition using a piecewise linear approximation (pseudocompounds) for the free energy surfaces of the system's possible phases. This strategy, as currently implemented in CONVEX, has been simplified and generalized for an arbitrary number of thermodynamic components.

Connolly & Petrini (2002) - describes the calculation of isochemical phase diagram sections using Perple_X's original optimization strategy for unconstrained free energy minimization (Connolly & Kerrick 1987). The algorithm described here was eliminated from Perple_X in 2006.
